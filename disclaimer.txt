This software holds a record of patient information entered by hospital staff. 
It does not give any clinical advice or recommendations on the diagnosis nor the treatment of patients. 
While the ICTA and Lunar Technologies have taken every effort in the production of this software to ensure 
that the information entered by the user is correctly recorded and displayed, it is ultimately the user 
of the system who takes full responsibility for the accuracy of this information.
